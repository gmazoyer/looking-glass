# Looking Glass

Easy to deploy Looking Glass made in PHP.

## Requirements

  * Webserver such as Apache 2, or Lighttpd, etcâ€¦
  * PHP (>= 7.0) module for the webserver (libapache2-mod-php for Apache 2 for
    example)
  * The XML package is required as well (php7.0-xml on Debian for example)

## Description

This web application made in PHP is what we call a **Looking Glass**. This is a
tool used to get some information about networks by giving the opportunity to
execute some commands on routers. The output is sent back to the user.

For now this looking glass is quite simple. Here you have some features:

  * Interface using Javascript and AJAX calls (needs a decent browser)
  * Support the following router types:
    * Arista
    * BIRD
    * Cisco (IOS and IOS-XR)
    * Extreme/Brocade NetIron
    * FRRouting
    * Huawei (VRP)
    * Juniper
    * Mikrotik/RouterOS
    * Nokia
    * OpenBGPd
    * Quagga
    * Vyatta/VyOS/EdgeOS
  * Support of Telnet and SSH connection to routers using password
    authentication and SSH keys
  * Configurable list of routers
  * Tweakable interface (title, logo, footer, elements order)
  * Log all commands in a file
  * Customizable output with regular expressions
  * Configurable list of allowed commands

And here is a list of what this looking glass should be able to do in the
future:

  * Support more routers
  * Support of other types of authentication

## Configuration

Copy the configuration **config.php.example** file to create a **config.php**
file. It contains all the values (PHP variables) used to customize the looking
glass. Details about configuration options are available in the
[documentation](docs/configuration.md).

## Docker

If you want to run the looking glass inside a Docker container, a Dockerfile
is provided in this repository. More details can be found
[here](docs/docker.md).

## Documentation

An up-to-date (hopefully) documentation is available in the **docs/**
directory. It gives enough details to setup the looking glass, to configure it
and to prepare your routers.
